# settings
Settings files for various computers

On Linux, this directory should be at "~/settings". Files and folders
can then be directly symlinked out to the home directory as needed,
e.g. `ln -s ~/settings/.vim ~/.vim`

For ZSH setup (e.g. on macOS), just symlink the `.zshenv` file by doing
`ln -s ~/settings/zsh/.zshenv ~/`
